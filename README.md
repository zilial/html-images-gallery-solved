# Image Gallery

## Introduction

In this assignment, you will be fixing the paths to service files, images, and pages of a Digital Art website. The website showcases modern frontend features, including mobile responsiveness using media queries, a Flexbox layout, mobile navigation, and CSS transparency.

To preview the app, simply click the "Go Live" button found in the VSCODE status bar. This will open your webpage in your browser.

If you are not using VSCode you can install and run the "live-server" npm package following the list of commands:

- [ ] Use `npm i live-server` to install the live-server package
- [ ] Use `npm run live-server` or `npx live-server --port=5551` to run the live-server. The port number should be 5551 strictly.

The live-server installation video: [Video](https://www.loom.com/share/ca99ebec79d14bfa9fc4dd012661f919?sid=0c702a22-c5bd-4608-93d2-0643aecb4b07)  
The live-server NPM package page: [Link](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server)

After completing the assignment, feel free to explore the CSS and JS files to get a glimpse of the technologies you will learn in future modules of the Devslopes curriculum.

Make sure to watch the [INTRO VIDEO](https://www.loom.com/share/c0569858f7d5421fab6e9597302e7dc1?sid=38906dd1-7efd-4d97-b8c1-e5e9870f3e02) before you start.

**!!! NOTE**: You will find the "[TODO Tree](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Gruntfuggly.todo-tree)" or the "[TODO Highlight](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jgclark.vscode-todo-highlight)" VSCode extension really useful for this assignment, as it will highlight every "TODO" keyword in the commented lines of the files you need to update.
